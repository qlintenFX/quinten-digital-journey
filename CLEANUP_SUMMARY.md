# Project Cleanup Summary

## Directories and Files Removed

1. **API and YouTube-related Directories**:
   - `/src/pages/api/` - Removed unused API directory
   - `/src/components/youtube/` - Removed empty YouTube component directory
   - `/src/app/youtube/` - Removed empty YouTube app directory

2. **Redundant Theme Hook**:
   - `/src/hooks/useThemeDetection.tsx` - Removed in favor of `use-theme.tsx`
   - We're keeping `use-theme.tsx` as it's actively used in the Layout component

3. **Demo Components**:
   - `/src/components/demo/` - Removed unused demo components

4. **Duplicate Logo**:
   - Removed duplicate `logokeyedcolors.png` from root directory
   - Kept the version in `/public` as it's being referenced in components

## Items Considered But Not Removed

1. **Index.tsx vs Home.tsx**:
   - `Index.tsx` serves as a wrapper that applies the layout to the Home component
   - It's being used in `App.tsx` routing, so it should be kept

2. **UI Components**:
   - While there may be unused UI components in `/src/components/ui/`, 
     these are part of a UI library system and removing individual components 
     could break interdependencies.
   - We recommend keeping the UI components library intact for now.

3. **Stylesheets**:
   - Both `index.css` and `App.css` appear to have different purposes:
     - `index.css` contains global styles
     - `App.css` contains App-specific styles
   - We recommend keeping both files separate for clarity.

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

For further optimization, consider:

1. Bundle analysis to identify large dependencies
2. Code splitting for lazy loading components
3. Review the extensive UI component library and consider removing unused components after thorough testing
4. Optimize image assets for web

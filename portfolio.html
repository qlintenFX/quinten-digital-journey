            <h2>4 Tips for finalizing your portfolio</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin your introduction by explaining the overall purpose of the portfolio. Briefly outline what the portfolio aims to showcase, such as your progress, key learning outcomes, and how the assignments reflect your understanding and application of the course material. Then, mention some of the most significant accomplishments or milestones from the assignments included in the portfolio. This sets the tone for what the reader can expect and draws attention to the areas where you excelled. Conclude the introduction by reflecting on your personal and academic growth throughout the course: discuss how your skills, knowledge, and perspectives have evolved.</li>
                <li>Discuss how your language skills have improved. Which mistakes did you make at first? What did you learn? How did you score on your online tests at first and then again later?</li>
                <li>Which exercises did you find hardest? Use screenshots from your language exercises or online tests to support your answer.</li>
                <li>Don't just apply your personal brand to your cover page. Apply it to the entire portfolio: the introduction, table of contents, subtitles, page numbers... Show effort and attention to detail. Make sure that if you use any images, it is not copyrighted, doesn't have a watermark and isn't of poor quality.</li>
                <li>Proofread and use your spelling checker. Don't try to rush and miss important details right before the finish line.</li>
            </ol>

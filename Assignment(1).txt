Intercultural workspaces  
[Quinten De Meyer] & [Alexander Conserva]  
For this assignment, you can decide to pair up with somebody or make the assignment alone. Please 
consider that you will have to stick with that decision the rest of the  first semester and the first half of 
the second semester.  
1. Playing by different rules  
In week 10, we play the  Barnga game . How did it go for you? Was it frustrating? Did you struggle 
when you had to move to a new table? What did you do when you hit resistance from other players? 
And finally: what does the simulation suggest about what to do when you are in this situation in  the 
‘real world’? Aim for 75 to 150 words.  
If later this semester you decide to make this assignment in pairs, just post each person’s answer 
underneath one another below. Once you get started on part 2 (intercultural body language) you will 
have to stick with your decision for the rest of the firs t and most of the second semester.  
 
 
Alexander: I just did not think about it. I just played and put cards and waited to see if I won or 
not. One round someone new came to our table and had already 3 cards before we even started 
and played different. Also, he sometimes did not want to put a c ard down so after the game he 
had still 4 cards left when he normally would have had 0 left. The hole table just went with it and 
left him be. But because of that I was the loser, so I had to leave the table. In the real world it 
shows that some people try   to adapt, resist, or just go with the flow.  
 
Quinten: I predicted that the rules for every table would be different. It went well for me and was 
not frustrating because if you just cheat with confidence and act like you won, the opponents 
cannot criticize you. They think you won by your rules, and wh at are they going to do, nothing. 
They are not allowed to convince me. I pick the trick and win they cannot steal it. However, one 
time I did steal, it was on the first game when I disagreed with the winner, pointed at my card, and 
acted like I won. He bel ieved me.

1.   Select two distinct cultures (e.g., Japanese, Brazilian etc.) known for their unique body language 
characteristics.   
2.   Conduct research on the  body language norms   and practices of each culture. You can use 
academic articles and credible websites to gather information. Focus on areas such as (hand) 
gestures, eye contact, proxemics, and touch. You can add other relevant areas.  
3.   Collect images, symbols, videos, or artworks that capture the spirit of the body language within 
these cultures.  
4.   Using the collected materials, create a visually engaging summary that outlines the key 
differences (and similarities, if you can find them) in body language between the two cultures. 
Include the before mentioned images, symbols, and short descriptions to  really support your 
story. These images support but do not replace your written conclusions.   
Remember what you learned about information management and scientific writing.   
Paste the result of your research below. Aim at 400 to 500 words.  
1. Greetings  
 
Saudi Arabia  
•   Handshakes are common among men but brief. Handshakes between genders are rare 
unless initiated by the woman.  
•   Placing the right hand over the heart after a handshake shows sincerity and respect.  
•   Men may greet close friends or family with a kiss on both cheeks, but this is gender 
related .  
India  
•   The "namaste" gesture (palms pressed together at chest level with a slight bow) is a 
common greeting.  
•   Younger individuals may touch elders’ feet as a sign of respect in traditional settings.  
•   A side - to - side head wobble indicates agreement, acknowledgment   or listening.

2.  Eye Contact  
Saudi Arabia  
•   Long   eye contact is common in same - gender interactions and shows trust.  
•   Cross - gender interactions avoid direct eye contact to maintain modesty .   L ooking at the 
chin is preferred.  
India  
•   Avoiding direct eye contact with elders or  superiors shows respect.  
•   In informal settings, direct eye contact is acceptable but varies by region.  
Page  2   out of  17  
 

Communication Skills 2  І   2024 - 205      
 
Similarities : Both cultures adjust eye contact based on social hierarchy, but Saudi norms are 
stricter due to Islam’s modesty.  
 
3. Gestures  
 
Saudi  Arabia:  
•   Beckoning is done with the palm facing down and fingers waving inward.  
•   Showing the soles of shoes or pointing feet at others is offensive.  
India:  
•   Touching someone’s head is considered disrespectful, not necessarily inappropriate, but 
generally avoided   especially for elders or in formal contexts.  
•   Pointing at objects with feet or showing the soles of feet is seen as rude.  
 
Similarities:  In both India and Saudi Arabia, using feet can be offensive and the direction of the 
beckoning hand (palm up or down) indicates respect.  
 
4. Personal Space and Touch  
 
Saudi Arabia  
•   Same - gender interactions involve close physical proximity (10 – 20 cm), but mixed - gender 
groups maintain distance.  
•   Same - gender friends may hold hands or link arms, but cross - gender touch is  restricted.  
India  
•   Personal space is smaller in crowded areas but larger in formal settings.  
•   Touch is conservative in public ,   handshakes are more common in urban areas.  
 
Difference : Saudi Arabia has stricter gender - based touch rules, while India’s norms vary between 
urban and rural areas.  
 
5. Unique Practices  
 
Saudi Arabia  
•   Raising hands palms - up during religious supplication (dua).  
•   Pauses during conversations show careful consideration, not discomfort.  
India  
•   Hand movements (mudras) in traditional  dances like Bharatanatyam.  
•   Silence during elders’ speech shows attentiveness, especially in rural areas.

3. Hofstede’s dimensions  
Research  Power Distance Index   in a specific culture. Try to narrow down that culture as much as 
possible. Cite your sources, separate fact from opinion and give specific examples. Aim at 500 to 550 
words.  
 
Intro  
Hofstede’s Power Distance Index indicates to which less powerful members of society accept 
unequal power distribution. Malaysia is well known for its very high PDI score, particularly within 
its dominant  Malay culture, where hierarchical relationships are deeply embedded in social, 
educational   and professional settings. According to Hofstede Insights, Malaysia’s overall PDI score 
is among the highest globally (Hofstede Insights,  n.d. ).  
 
Key Characteristics:  
•   Hierarchical Structures:  
o   Formal authority is respected in government, business and family systems.  
o   Decision - making is centralized, with senior figures holding considerable influence.  
•   Cultural Traditions:  
o   Malay traditions, intertwined with Islamic  values, emphasize respect for elders 
and authority.  
o   Traditional practices in ceremonies and education further reinforce hierarchy.  
•   Organizational  Behaviour :  
o   In many Malaysian companies (e.g., state - owned enterprises), instructions flow 
top - down and subordinates rarely challenge decisions.  
o   Educational institutions often rely on teacher authority, reflecting the broader 
soci al   acceptance of hierarchical order.  
Specific Examples:  
•   Educational Settings:   Malaysian schools typically follow a strict teacher - student hierarchy 
where questioning authority is uncommon.  
•   Family Dynamics:   Within traditional Malay households, elders hold decision - making 
power and are re spect ed, further  following   the national cultural norm.  
 
 
Fact vs. Opinion:  
•   Fact:   Malaysian culture, particularly among ethnic Malays is characterized by a high 
acceptance of unequal power distribution   as demonstrated by  standard   practices and 
everyday interactions (Hofstede Insights,  n.d. ).  
 
•   Opinion:    
Quinten:   I think  while this hierarchical structure can create social stability and clear lines 
of responsibili ties , it may also hinder creative ness  in  work   environments where 
collaborative problem   solving is  important, because people might be too scared to come 
with their own views and ideas .  
 
Alexander:   I feel like people would just not share their opinion or question the  discissions  
of a higher up . This could be bad for the company because it could be a bad discission and 
some employees may know   it but just don’t say anything.  
 
Summary:  
Page  5   out of  17  
 

Communication Skills 2  І   2024 - 205      
•   Fact Summary:  
o   Malaysia’s PDI is exceptionally high.  
o   Hierarchy is reinforced in education, business and family life.  
o   Cultural traditions and religious values support a  top - down   power structure.  
•   Opinion Summary:  
o   Quinten:   stability and structure   at the cost of creativeness and  equality.  
o   Alexander:   People can’t be themselves and share their opinion.  
 
Conclusion  
Malaysian culture provides a n   interesting   situation   for understanding high PDI. The inter action   of 
religious values, traditional customs and modern organizational practices creates a consistent 
acceptance of hierarchy. While the stability this brings is valuable, there is also an emerging 
conversation on how to balance respect for authority with the   need for creative, participatory 
decision - making. This picture is essential for anyone studying the dynamics of power in culturally 
diverse societies .

Choose a culture from a different continent than the culture you discussed for PDI. Research 
individualism   in that culture. Cite your sources, separate fact from  opinion and give specific 
examples. Aim at 500 to 550 words.  
 
Individualism in the United States  
The United States is one of the most individualistic society in the world. According to Geert 
Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory the U.S. scores 91 out of 100 on the Individualism Index 
making it one of the highest globally. This score indicates a cultu ral importance on personal 
freedom, self - reliance and individual achievement over group harmony or collective identity 
(Hofstede Insights, n.d.).  
In highly individualistic cultures like the U.S., people are primarily expected to look after 
themselves and their family. Success is also typically measured in terms of personal 
accomplishments such as career achievements, wealth or public recognition. Th e cultural story of 
the “American Dream” reinforces the idea that anyone can succeed through individual effort and 
determination.  
Page  6   out of  17  
 

Communication Skills 2  І   2024 - 205      
This conflicts with collectivist societies where group membership, loyalty and friendships are 
prioritized. In the U.S. independence is taught from an early age where children are encouraged to 
make their own decisions, express their personal opinions and  develop a unique identity.  
A typical American teenager might leave their hometown at 18 to attend university in another 
state, a move that reflects both independence and social expectation. In collectivist cultures like 
China or India young adults may remain with or close to their f amilies much longer.  
The U.S. is also a low - context communication culture which means people are more direct and 
clear. This aligns with individualistic values like self - expression and assertiveness are seen as 
strengths. Silence in conversations is often uncomfortable as it m ay be interpreted as a lack of 
opinion or disengagement.  
In a professional setting American employees are expected to speak up during meetings and ask 
questions. Performance reviews often focus on individual contributions and rewards such as 
promotions or bonuses are usually individual  rather   than group based.  
Individual responsibility is both empowering and stressful. But while it creates room for innovation 
and personal growth it can also lead to pressure as individuals may feel only accountable for their 
successes or failures. But I do feel like Americans can   also be more confident in themselves than 
other  countries .  
In customer service Americans generally expect responses. If there’s a problem ,   customers are 
encouraged to voice complaints directly and companies see this as valuable feedback.   
The high level of individualism in the U.S. shapes everything from education and work to family life 
and communication. While this promotes self - expression, innovation and freedom it also means 
that individuals must navigate life largely on their own. Unde rstanding these traits is essential for 
intercultural communication, especially when working with or within American society.

Choose a culture from a different continent than the previous cultures you discussed. Research 
masculinity   and the prevalence of the  male gaze   in that culture. Cite your sources, separate fact 
from opinion and give specific examples. Comparing your chosen culture to other cultures may help

Masculinity and the Male Gaze in Hungary  
 
Hungary is one of the most traditionally  masculine countries in Europe. According to Hofstede’s 
Masculinity Index, it scores 88 out of 100. That means Hungarian culture tends to value things like 
competition, ambition and success. People often measure success by how much money someone 
makes, thei r job title or what they own. There are also clearer expectations for how men and 
women should behave with more pressure to stick to traditional gender roles.  
 
In Hungary, men are often expected to be strong, confident and not show too much emotion. 
M eanwhile   women , are more likely to be judged based on how they look or how well they take 
care of a family. This ties into the idea of the male gaze, a way of seeing the world where women 
are mainly viewed through a man’s perspective, often as objects of beauty rather t han full 
complex people.  
 
You can see this in Hungarian media. On TV and in ads, women are often shown as housewives, 
love interests or models, while men are shown as leaders, workers or problem - solvers. In talent 
shows or reality TV, women often get comments about their appearance   or outfits, while men are 
judged more for what they do. This reinforces the idea that women should be looked at and men 
should act.  
 
This divide also shows up at work. In Hungary, far fewer women hold leadership roles compared to 
the European average. Men are more likely to be seen as the ones in charge, while women are 
often expected to take on support roles. Things are changing slowly , but it can still be harder for 
women to get ahead in careers that reward assertiveness and dominance, traits that are more 
traditionally linked with masculinity.  
 
Masculinity also shapes how emotions are handled. Hungarian men are usually expected to stay 
tough and keep their feelings to themselves. Being independent and in control is valued more than 
being open or vulnerable. Because of this, many men feel pressure   to hide their stress or mental 
health struggles, which can lead to serious issues that go untreated.  
 
On the  other   side, Sweden is one of the least masculine countries, scoring just 5 out of 100 on the 
same index. Swedish culture puts more emphasis on things like quality of life, cooperation and 
balance between work and personal life. Gender roles are more flexible an d both men and women 
are encouraged to show emotion and share responsibilities at home and work.  
 
For example, in Sweden both parents are given generous leave when they have a child and it’s 
totally normal for dads to stay home and take care of their kids. In Hungary, even though the same 
leave exists, it’s mostly mothers who use it. Swedish media also   tends to show more realistic and 
respectful portrayals of women, with less focus on how they look and more on who they are.  
 
Hungary is slowly changing, but traditional masculine values still shape how people think about 
gender, power and identity. Understanding these cultural patterns helps explain both the 
challenges people face and the progress that’s being made. When you com pare it to Sweden, it 
becomes clear how different ideas about masculinity and gender roles can really shape everyday 
life, from the workplace and media to relationships and emotional well - being.

Understanding Uncertainty Avoidance in Portugal  
Portugal is one of the countries with the highest scores on Hofstede’s Uncertainty Avoidance 
Index, scoring 104 just behind Greece at the top of the list. This means that people in  Portugal 
generally don’t like uncertainty or unexpected changes. They prefer things to be clear, well -
planned and organized.  
In Portuguese culture rules and structure are very important. People like to know what to expect 
and often follow systems that help reduce the unknown. For example, in the workplace decisions 
usually go through a proper process with signatures, official do cuments or approvals. Things aren’t 
typically done on the spot or without a plan. Everything tends to be carefully thought out and 
discussed ahead of time.  
The same goes for their daily life and education. Students are taught to follow set rules and stick to 
what the curriculum says. There’s not as much focus on thinking outside the box or doing things in 
new ways. Being prepared and sticking to the plan is w hat makes people feel secure.  
Of course, this way of thinking also shows up in how people deal with time. Punctuality is 
important and planning ahead is common. People like to know what’s happening next instead of 
just going with the flow.  
On the other hand, this need for certainty can sometimes slow things down. It might make it 
harder for new ideas or changes to take place quickly. For example, in places like Denmark or 
Jamaica countries with a low UAI, the people are more relaxed about ru les and more open to 
change. They’re comfortable figuring things out as they go, while in Portugal people tend to feel 
more stressed if there’s no clear plan or structure.  
Portuguese culture values stability, clear instructions and careful  planning. This makes the country 
feel safe and predictable for many people. But it can also mean that creativity or quick changes 
take longer to be accepted. Knowing this can really help when working with Portuguese people or 
businesses, as it helps you un derstand why they may prefer doing things a certain way.

Long - Term Orientation in Japan  
Page  10   out of  17  
 

Communication Skills 2  І   2024 - 205      
Japan is a prime example of a high Long - Term Orientation culture. According to Hofstede’s 
framework, Japan ranks high in this dimension, meaning its society values future rewards, 
perseverance and continuous self - improvement (Hofstede   Insights, n.d.).  
T his long - term mindset is deeply embedded in Japanese business culture and social life. Japanese 
companies like Toyota and Sony are renowned for their focus on sustainable growth, long - term 
planning and quality through methods such as  Kaizen .  T he practice of continuous improvement. 
These companies often prioritize long - term reputation over short - term profits, making decisions 
that may take years to  develop .  
Education is another area where Japan’s high LTO is evident. Students are expected to dedicate 
themselves to academic and moral development from an early age and competition for entrance 
into prestigious universities is intense. This cultural commitment an d discipline is mirrored in 
Japan’s strong work ethic and respect for elders and teachers.  
While I respect the discipline and planning behind Japan’s high LTO, it honestly sounds exhausting. 
It’s common that employees can’t leave the office until their boss does and if the boss wants to go 
out for drinks   you’re expected to go. That level of social  obligation and pressure explains why so 
many people are tired and burnt out. It’s a system that values long - term gains, but it seems to 
come at the cost of personal well - being.

down that culture as much as possible. Cite your sources, separate fact from opinion and give specific 
examples. Comparing your chosen culture to other cultures may help you m ake your point more

Indulgence in Mexican Culture  
Mexico is one of the most indulgent countries in the world, scoring 97 out of 100 on Hofstede’s 
Indulgence Index. That basically means people in Mexico believe in enjoying life, expressing 
emotions and having fun. There’s a strong cultural focus on living in the moment and finding joy in 
everyday experiences.  
 
One clear example of this is how Mexicans celebrate. Holidays like Día de los Muertos (Day of the 
Dead) and Las Posadas are full of  colour , music, dancing and food. These aren’t just parties ,  they’re 
deep traditions that show how important it is to celebrate life, even when remembering those 
who have passed. Community gatherings and emotional expression are at the heart of these 
events.  
 
In day - to - day life, you also see this indulgent mindset. People in Mexico often value personal time, 
relationships and enjoyment more than strict routines. There’s a popular saying: “Mexicans don’t 
live to work ,   they work to live.” That really captures how fun, connection and enjoying the present 
are seen as essential parts of life.  
 
You’ll also notice that people tend to be warm and expressive. Hugs, cheek kisses and lively 
conversations are common. Whether it’s through music, dancing or just chatting with friends, 
showing emotion openly is a normal and welcome part of social life.  
 
When you compare this to more restrained cultures ,  like Russia or Pakistan ,  there’s a big 
difference. In those places social norms or religious rules often limit open emotional expression or 
indulgent  behaviour . In contrast, Mexico encourages people to be spontaneous, optimistic and 
emotionally open.  
 
In a work setting, this cultural style can be important to understand. Celebrating birthdays or 
promotions at the office is common and building personal connections can help build trust. At the 
same time people from more structured cultures, like Germany o r Japan, might find Mexico’s 
relaxed attitude toward time or deadlines a bit challenging. That’s why cultural awareness 
matters,  being flexible and respectful goes a long way.

Overall, indulgence is a big part of what makes Mexican culture so lively and welcoming. It’s not 
just about having fun ,  it’s about finding joy in life, expressing yourself freely and staying connected 
to others.

4. Professional Growth  
How did you experience the  International Days   in March? Did you notice any cultural differences in 
the workshops you attended? Were you able to network or learn anything new? Can you see the 
value in intercultural exchange of knowledge and experience?  
 
Quinten:   I really liked the team  project,   but  I   didn’t find the lectures useful.   The  lectures   felt more 
like a promotional advertisement for their business / school.   The fact that they were from a 
different country didn’t highlight a different culture at all. The lecturers mostly just taught   about 
what they  do, and it wasn’t really that useful for me .  
 
As for the  team  project,   I really liked working with students with a different study program. A 
team member studied  agriculture   so he could guide us with his knowledge about  farming and 
possibilities .   Another member studied business, so he was very strong at pitching our idea.  Now 
the unfortunate part was that we had no international student in our team so we basically all had 
Belgian culture. There were 2 foreign   teachers, but their help didn’t feel any more different than a 
Belgian teacher.  
 
So all in al l, it was a fun learning experience featuring teamwork  with colleagues studying different 
capabilities.  However,   I didn’t feel any impact or benefit of calling it a multicultural international 
da y. This day felt more like a forced “work in  English ” day .  
 
Alexander:   I find that the workshops I attended  didn’t have any cultural differences other th a n 
speaking good English because the first lecture  it was difficult to understand sometimes.  I learned 
that   working with a team you have never seen before or talked to is very difficult if you have to 
make a project on the same day.  But it did show me how intercultural exchange can add value to a 
project.  
At some point this schoolyear, you will attend a guest lecture by  Sophie Mirgaux . What did you learn 
from this lecture? How did you perform in the workshop? Aim for 75 to 150 words.  
 
Quinten:   Sophie Mirgaux works with the Belgian federal government   in   Belgium's Special Envoy 
for the Ocean .  The ocean doesn’t have a voice for itself, so she acts a bit like the ocean’s voice. She 
spoke about her role in  the UN with Diplomats and negotiators .   She talked about our importance 
and activities at  Belgium's   sea. Activities like p ioneering with windmills, researching the ocean, 
experimenting and innovating system for the ocean , even preserving nature, life and habitats in 
the ocean .   Belgium doesn’ t have that much power as the US and  Russia   which have a lot of 
conflicting opinions.  
 
There is a lot of negotiating in EU’s  rotating presidency system, they need to prepare a lot of 
proposals for Belgium to have a better chance of being included.   A lot of focus was put on the fact 
that waste will end up in the ocean, thus ending up in our bodies. This en courages  us to recycle.  
 
Alexander:   From t his video  I learned that   culture affects the way we communicate , n ot just what 
we say ,   but how we say it. Sherwood Fleming talked about something called “cultural autopilot” 
where we all have these default ways of speaking based on where  we   are   from and we don’t even 
realize it. She als o said   that all communication basically boils down to five things: making requests, 
offers, promises, sharing opinions and declarations. What really stuck with me is how easily 
misunderstandings can happen even when everyone speaks English , j ust because of tone or body 
language. The biggest tip was to keep things clear and simple especially in international or

Communication Skills 2  І   2024 - 205      
business situations. It’s not about sounding super fancy . I t’s about making sure the other person 
gets what you mean .   ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okx6blzW1Kw )  
 
In general, what have you learned from your research and the classes and events you attended? This 
encompasses both the first and second semester. How would you use these new perspectives in your 
future career ?  
 
Alexander:   Looking back at everything I worked on during this course, I’ve definitely learned a lot. 
Not just about IT, history or culture, but also about myself.   
One of the biggest things I noticed is that I’m now more aware of how culture shapes the way 
people live, think and work. Before, I didn’t really pay much attention to cultural differences or 
their impact. But after researching these topics I've started to   see things from a wider perspective.   
Also learning how to deal with different types of people and how to give presentations.   
Visiting the Africa Museum especially changed my view on museums. I used to think they were 
boring, but after that visit it showed me how meaningful they can be. It even made me curious to 
visit more.  
 
Quinten:   This assignment showed me how much culture affects how people work, think, and 
communicate. Different countries have different values, like how they handle power, emotions, or 
personal space, and that really matters in teamwork , especially when there are different cultures 
working together .   What stood out to me most was how useful it is to work with people from 
different backgrounds or fields. Everyone brings something different, and it makes the end result 
stronger   and have more perspectives . I di dn’t just learn facts ,  I learned how to be more aware and 
flexible, which I think will help in any future job.

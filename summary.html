            <pre>
Communication Skills 2  І   2024 - 2025      
Understanding my client  
Kynan Van Looy ,  Quinten De Meyer ,  Lukas M ue s  
1.  First  impressions  
how  will you   ensure you will make a good impression when you meet your client for the first time?  
Aim for  75   to 1 00   words.   In SKIL2, you will be placed in teams together. Then, you can copy all team 
members' answers into one document from which you will continue to work for the next six weeks.  
 
•   Kynan Van Looy :  I will make sure to be dressed properly and have a smile on my face when 
the client arrives. Then I will greet the client in a professional way before we go inside. I 
will make sure  I   have  all the items I need prepared before the client arrives, that way  I  
don't have to grab everything   from my backpack last minute. I will listen to the client 
carefully and make sure I understand the problem. I will also try to make the client feel like 
I understand them.   
 
•   Quinten De Meyer :  I will ensure I arrive on time, allowing me to approach the meeting 
without rushing and stumbling about, having all the items prepared. My clothing will be 
appropriate for the setting, it is a formal meeting after all. A firm handshake when meeting 
the cli ent can set a positive tone for myself and the client. I will speak calmly, avoiding 
stuttering or rushing, and maintain a steady pace with my words. Matching the client's 
formality and communication style, I will use open body language,  smile, and maintain eye 
contact to convey confidence. I will show no signs of nervousness, staying composed 
throughout the meeting. Most importantly, I will listen attentively to the client and 
respond thoughtfully to the things they say.  
 
•   Lukas M ue s :  I walk calmly towards him and say hello in a friendly manner, giving a firm 
handshake. I make sure to have a smile on my face and look him or her in the eyes. Just 
after shaking hands, I ask how they are doing. During the conversation, I make sure that all  
my attention is focused on the client who is speaking, and I give signals throughout the 
conversation to show that I am interested.  
 
 
2.  Client workshop  
How will you prepare for your client workshop? What would you keep in mind? What will you 
certainly (not) do?  
 
We will make sure everyone is present and arrives on time.   Everyone  wears  appropriate clothing  
that matches the general style of the team .  We will prepare a ll the items   to take notes, read the 
questions, etc. in advance .   We'll make sure everyone gets a chance to have an interaction with the 
client, ensuring the conversation is not only between two people.   The whole team will greet the 
client in a professional way. Our phone notifications will be turned off to ensure the conversation 
won't be interrupted .  
 
 
Which questions do you want to ask during your first client workshop?  
First, we   will ask the client their  main  problem.  Then we will go more in depth about the problem, 
asking for more details to ensure we understand the  problem properly.   After that we will ask what  
the   results   are   the client  is   expect ing in the   long term and short term   and what  the client  expects 
from  the team .  
 
 
Which feedback did you receive from your client during or after the workshop?  
We didn't receive any feedback during this session   as both clients for the projects were in front of 
the class and let us ask questions together with the other groups.   
 
 
3 .  Business case  
You will have to create a business case for your client. Create this business case in the separate 
template and  submit it along with this file for assignment 1.   
Please keep in mind that spelling and grammar will contribute to your final grade.  
4. Client demo  
How will you prepare for your client workshop? What would you keep in mind? What will you 
certainly (not) do?  
 
We will make sure everyone is present and is dressed properly. We write down the most 
important t opics to discuss and show. We also assign one member to take notes during our 
meeting  so we can always look back to the feedback and wishes of our client.   We will make sure 
that we introduce everyone properly and end with a summarisation of what we have talked about, 
to ensure that we are on the same page as our client.   
 
 
   
Which questions do you want to ask during your first client workshop?  
 
•   W hen   is the IT - polis event ?    
•   H ow long does the event take ?  
•   H ow many stands will there be ?  
•   H ow many people are expected to go to the event ?  This includes students, lecturers 
and visitors.  
•   Can we gather the serial numbers of the participating students to make sure they 
can't vote ?  
•   Examples to propose :  
-   NFC - tag + s canning student cards  
-   NFC - tag  on its own  
-   Code o n a paper card  
-   Google Form   with  code  - >  If not   G oogle Forms:  Thomas More datacentre available 
or not ?  
•   How many voting stands are required ?  
 
 
After the demo, you will have to send your client a professional email to confirm the feedback that 
you have received from them and what you will do with it.  Copy - paste that email here.  
 
Geachte Mevrouw Renders,   
 
Graag vat ik in deze e - mail ons gesprek van eerder kort samen. We hebben vernomen dat u ons 
concept van NFC - tags als een interessant idee beschouwt. Daarnaast gaf u aan dat u graag een 
manier zou  willen vinden om mensen meer te motiveren om daadwerkelijk te gaan stemmen.   
 
Uw feedback waarderen wij ten zeerste, en wij zullen ons uiterste best doen om dit aspect verder 
uit te werken. Mocht u nog aanvullende vragen of opmerkingen hebben, dan horen wij dit graag. 
Wij nemen uw input uiteraard mee in het verdere proces.   
 
Alvast hartelijk dank voor uw tijd en ondersteuning.   
 
Met vriendelijke groet,   
Kynan Van Looy  
KRE1  
5. Professional growth  
What have you learned from your first client  communication? What went well and what could have 
gone better? Please name at the very least one thing you could do better next time.  
 
We learned that being well prepared helps a lot during the meeting, we will keep  preparing 
oursel ves . Next time we will ask less but better questions.   We will also make sure that we make 
our introduction and summarisation better.

            <h2>Assignment 3: Humanity in IT</h2>
            <pre>
Communication Skills  2   І   202 4 - 205      
Humanity in IT  
[ Alexander   Conserva ] & [ Quinten   De Meyer ]  
1.  First reflections  
In week 7, you will have a class on cultural appropriation and stereotypes. After that class, write 
down your first reflections on cultural  appropriation and stereotypes. This can be in the workplace, in 
your personal life or based on personal experiences. Aim for 100 to 150 words.  
Before  the lesson  I never really thought about it   like for Halloween I thought it was fine and 
normal to dress up  in   anything you want   but now I see that for  non - dominant groups  this is not 
nice . I didn't  realize   it could enforce stereotypes or misunderstandings for these cultures .  
I (Quinten) have  realized   I  unknowingly appropriated Saudi Drifting culture by making videos of 
playing a game and doing Saudi drifting (Hajwala / Tafheet). I didn't in tent to be malicious but now 
see that it's damaging to the car culture of  Saudi Arabia .   I also used the wrong  music for these 
videos.  
I (Alexander)  at  scho ol when I was  young,   they also did like the  'I ndianen   dans'   and dressed up as 
In dian s   for kids but that also has been  cultural  appropriation,   so you do it already in school when 
you\'re   young. You kind of grow up doing it.    
 
2.  Research  
In week 8, you will have a class on how IT can impact our worldview. Pick a culturally relevant topic 
of your own and research it. Aim for 500 to 600 words, excluding your bibliography. Provide enough 
background information and make sure to separate fact f rom opinion.  You are encouraged to share 
your opinion, but make sure you frame it as such and can give multiple, strong points of 
argumentation. Three different sources in your text and bibliography  are   the absolute minimum.  
 
The impact of IT on  political   activism  
 
IT  has completely changed politic al activism  because you can now use the internet  to spread 
information   on ,   for example social media platforms   or even your own website.   But this could also 
be a negative because of this you also get a lot of misinformation , you get government 
surveillance and  even online censorship.  
 
One of the biggest impacts of IT is how it helps people organize and  act   quickly. Social media 
platforms like Twitter and Facebook allow activists to share updates and gather support. For 
example, during the Arab Spring in 2010 – 2012 social media played a key role in helping people 
organize protests and share what was happening   with the world. In the 2019 Hong Kong protests, 
apps like Telegram were used for secure communication to avoid government tracking.    
 
IT also makes it easier to reach a bigger audience.   For example ,   by using hashtags like  #BLM  The 
Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 gained massive support thanks to the hashtags and viral videos 
that exposed injustices.  
 
Alexander:   I find the internet   very useful for all the information you can find  but I feel like activist 
are very dependent of platforms like Facebook, Twitter or even TikTok now   and if they want ,   they 
can just delete the videos or posts .  
 
Quinten :  S ocial media has become the easiest way to find information from individual people and  
media from around the world. IT has made it possible for everyone to be connected and share 
opinions and information about situations which is a  double - edged   sword still.  
 
While IT help s with  spreading  useful information,  there is also  mis information   that gets spread .  
For example ,   a lot of social media  platforms   push content that gets a lot of views and likes to more 
people even if  it's not correct information .   Or even during the 2016 U.S. election, fake news stories 
and misleading posts were shared   confusing voters and  their   opinions .  
 
Alexander:  I n my opinion  this is the  scariest   thing  about   IT because some people  believe certain 
things that  are or   are   not true ,   but they don't even know that it isn't true. Because sometimes they 
watch   a short video and believe what the person said but you should always do your own research 
before believing  it.  
 
Quinten:   I don't like how misinformation and disinformation are easily spread on social media. 
They can give millions, even billions, the wrong perspective on something, which can become 
harmful to  lots   of people. Propaganda is now much easier to  spread   on these platforms.  Also , with 
AI, footage can be  convincingly manipulated, potentially having harmful impacts on the lives of 
many people.  
 
It   helps activists but   it also makes the government can track   them.   Some countries have tools like 
facial recognition cameras  and even internet shutdown s   to try and stop protests. For example , 
during Hong Kong   protest people had to use umbrellas and laser pointers   to not get identified by 
the facial recognition cameras.  
 
Alexander:  In think that protestors should   implement more anonymous and secure chat rooms  to 
communicate with each other because in some  countries   they could get in a lot of trouble. But 
even for us I think   we should  take privacy more   seriously   because everything we do online can be 
tracked by your internet provider.   I also find that wanting to  have more privacy by using tools like 
Tails OS   gives a wrong impression to thinking that you are probably doing something illegal   but 
you're   just taking privacy more  seriously .  
 
Quinten:   IT has transformed political activism making it easier to organize and spread awareness. 
However ,   it also  leads to   misinformation and surveillance. IT is a powerful tool for activism, but it 
needs to be used carefully.

3. Growth as an IT professional  
This exercise should contribute to your growth as an IT professional. Briefly reflect on what you have 
learned and  how   you will use this once you graduate and enter the workforce. Avoid broad, vague or 
general statements. Aim for 100 to 200 words.  
 
Alexander :  I have learned that  you should take  privacy  very serious  and also try and stay 
anonymous online by using tools like Tails OS , e specially if you are  an   activist .   I didn't know that in 
some countries  it was this strict with even internet shutdowns and  identifying you from social 
media to real life with facial recognition cameras.   Once I graduate ,   I will always try to  stay safe and 
anonymous online and don't believe everything on the internet.   Always do your own research 
before believing  in   someone else.   When I   work with data ,   I would  make sure that   it   is secure   so 
nobody could use this information for a bad purpose.  At work or even life in general I would try 
not  to   make  stereotypes and keep in mind non - d ominant groups .   For example ,   because we are 
from the IT world it  would have  happened   once where you make a joke  of Indian scammers and 
use the ir   accent but if someone from  India hears th at   they wouldn't like it.  
 
Quinten:   I have learned how IT both helps and endangers activists   and users o nline .  When   I 
graduate, I will  use IT   responsibly   and avoid spreading misinformation, I will also instruct people 
measures to take on the internet . I will take privacy seriously in  personal   and professional settings, 
applying secure tools and promoting ethical  practices . I will   also   be mindful of cultural  aspects  in 
IT, reflecting on my past experiences like my  cultural  appropriation of Saudi drifting. This 
awareness  has helped me in spotting cultural appropriation and other malpractices .   I aim to 
continuously educate myself and others on ethical IT practices to create a more inclusive online 
environment .

Communication Skills 2  І   2024 - 205      
Intercultural workspaces  
[Quinten De Meyer] & [Alexander Conserva]  
For this assignment, you can decide to pair up with somebody or make the assignment alone. Please 
consider that you will have to stick with that decision the rest of the  first semester and the first half of 
the second semester.  
1. Playing by different rules  
In week 10, we play the  Barnga game . How did it go for you? Was it frustrating? Did you struggle 
when you had to move to a new table? What did you do when you hit resistance from other players? 
And finally: what does the simulation suggest about what to do when you are in this situation in  the 
'real world'? Aim for 75 to 150 words.  
If later this semester you decide to make this assignment in pairs, just post each person's answer 
underneath one another below. Once you get started on part 2 (intercultural body language) you will 
have to stick with your decision for the rest of the firs t and most of the second semester.  
 
Alexander: I just did not think about it. I just played and put cards and waited to see if I won or 
not. One round someone new came to our table and had already 3 cards before we even started 
and played different. Also, he sometimes did not want to put a c ard down so after the game he 
had still 4 cards left when he normally would have had 0 left. The hole table just went with it and 
left him be. But because of that I was the loser, so I had to leave the table. In the real world it 
shows that some people try   to adapt, resist, or just go with the flow.  
 
Quinten: I predicted that the rules for every table would be different. It went well for me and was 
not frustrating because if you just cheat with confidence and act like you won, the opponents 
cannot criticize you. They think you won by your rules, and wh at are they going to do, nothing. 
They are not allowed to convince me. I pick the trick and win they cannot steal it. However, one 
time I did steal, it was on the first game when I disagreed with the winner, pointed at my card, and 
acted like I won. He bel ieved me.  
 
2. Intercultural body language  
1.   Select two distinct cultures (e.g., Japanese, Brazilian etc.) known for their unique body language 
characteristics.   
2.   Conduct research on the  body language norms   and practices of each culture. You can use 
academic articles and credible websites to gather information. Focus on areas such as (hand) 
gestures, eye contact, proxemics, and touch. You can add other relevant areas.  
3.   Collect images, symbols, videos, or artworks that capture the spirit of the body language within 
these cultures.  
4.   Using the collected materials, create a visually engaging summary that outlines the key 
differences (and similarities, if you can find them) in body language between the two cultures. 
Include the before mentioned images, symbols, and short descriptions to  really support your 
story. These images support but do not replace your written conclusions.   
Remember what you learned about information management and scientific writing.   
Paste the result of your research below. Aim at 400 to 500 words.  
1. Greetings  
 
Saudi Arabia  
•   Handshakes are common among men but brief. Handshakes between genders are rare 
unless initiated by the woman.  
•   Placing the right hand over the heart after a handshake shows sincerity and respect.  
•   Men may greet close friends or family with a kiss on both cheeks, but this is gender 
related .  
India  
•   The "namaste" gesture (palms pressed together at chest level with a slight bow) is a 
common greeting.  
•   Younger individuals may touch elders' feet as a sign of respect in traditional settings.  
•   A side - to - side head wobble indicates agreement, acknowledgment   or listening.

2.  Eye Contact  
Saudi Arabia  
•   Long   eye contact is common in same - gender interactions and shows trust.  
•   Cross - gender interactions avoid direct eye contact to maintain modesty . L ooking at the 
chin is preferred.  
India  
•   Avoiding direct eye contact with elders or  superiors shows respect.  
•   In informal settings, direct eye contact is acceptable but varies by region.  
 
Similarities : Both cultures adjust eye contact based on social hierarchy, but Saudi norms are 
stricter due to Islam's modesty.  
 
3. Gestures  
 
Saudi  Arabia:  
•   Beckoning is done with the palm facing down and fingers waving inward.  
•   Showing the soles of shoes or pointing feet at others is offensive.  
India:  
•   Touching someone's head is considered disrespectful, not necessarily inappropriate, but 
generally avoided   especially for elders or in formal contexts.  
•   Pointing at objects with feet or showing the soles of feet is seen as rude.  
 
Similarities:  In both India and Saudi Arabia, using feet can be offensive and the direction of the 
beckoning hand (palm up or down) indicates respect.  
 
4. Personal Space and Touch  
 
Saudi Arabia  
•   Same - gender interactions involve close physical proximity (10 – 20 cm), but mixed - gender 
groups maintain distance.  
•   Same - gender friends may hold hands or link arms, but cross - gender touch is  restricted.  
India  
•   Personal space is smaller in crowded areas but larger in formal settings.  
•   Touch is conservative in public ,   handshakes are more common in urban areas.  
 
Difference : Saudi Arabia has stricter gender - based touch rules, while India's norms vary between 
urban and rural areas.  
 
5. Unique Practices  
 
Saudi Arabia  
•   Raising hands palms - up during religious supplication (dua).  
•   Pauses during conversations show careful consideration, not discomfort.  
India  
•   Hand movements (mudras) in traditional  dances like Bharatanatyam.  
•   Silence during elders' speech shows attentiveness, especially in rural areas.

3. Hofstede's dimensions  
Research  Power Distance Index   in a specific culture. Try to narrow down that culture as much as 
possible. Cite your sources, separate fact from opinion and give specific examples. Aim at 500 to 550 
words.  
 
Intro  
Hofstede's Power Distance Index indicates to which less powerful members of society accept 
unequal power distribution. Malaysia is well known for its very high PDI score, particularly within 
its dominant  Malay culture, where hierarchical relationships are deeply embedded in social, 
educational   and professional settings. According to Hofstede Insights, Malaysia's overall PDI score 
is among the highest globally (Hofstede Insights,  n.d. ).  
 
Key Characteristics:  
•   Hierarchical Structures:  
o   Formal authority is respected in government, business and family systems.  
o   Decision - making is centralized, with senior figures holding considerable influence.  
•   Cultural Traditions:  
o   Malay traditions, intertwined with Islamic  values, emphasize respect for elders 
and authority.  
o   Traditional practices in ceremonies and education further reinforce hierarchy.  
•   Organizational  Behaviour :  
o   In many Malaysian companies (e.g., state - owned enterprises), instructions flow 
top - down and subordinates rarely challenge decisions.  
o   Educational institutions often rely on teacher authority, reflecting the broader 
soci al   acceptance of hierarchical order.  
Specific Examples:  
•   Educational Settings:   Malaysian schools typically follow a strict teacher - student hierarchy 
where questioning authority is uncommon.  
•   Family Dynamics:   Within traditional Malay households, elders hold decision - making 
power and are re spect ed, further  following   the national cultural norm.  
 
Fact vs. Opinion:  
•   Fact:   Malaysian culture, particularly among ethnic Malays is characterized by a high 
acceptance of unequal power distribution   as demonstrated by  standard   practices and 
everyday interactions (Hofstede Insights,  n.d. ).  
 
•   Opinion:    
Quinten:   I think  while this hierarchical structure can create social stability and clear lines 
of responsibili ties , it may also hinder creative ness  in  work   environments where 
collaborative problem   solving is  important, because people might be too scared to come 
with their own views and ideas .  
 
Alexander:   I feel like people would just not share their opinion or question the  discissions  
of a higher up . This could be bad for the company because it could be a bad discission and 
some employees may know   it but just don't say anything.  
 
Summary:  
•   Fact Summary:  
o   Malaysia's PDI is exceptionally high.  
o   Hierarchy is reinforced in education, business and family life.  
o   Cultural traditions and religious values support a  top - down   power structure.  
•   Opinion Summary:  
o   Quinten:   stability and structure   at the cost of creativeness and  equality.  
o   Alexander:   People can't be themselves and share their opinion.  
 
Conclusion  
Malaysian culture provides a n   interesting   situation   for understanding high PDI. The inter action   of 
religious values, traditional customs and modern organizational practices creates a consistent 
acceptance of hierarchy. While the stability this brings is valuable, there is also an emerging 
conversation on how to balance respect for authority with the   need for creative, participatory 
decision - making. This picture is essential for anyone studying the dynamics of power in culturally 
diverse societies .

Choose a culture from a different continent than the culture you discussed for PDI. Research 
individualism   in that culture. Cite your sources, separate fact from  opinion and give specific 
examples. Aim at 500 to 550 words.  
 
Individualism in the United States  
The United States is one of the most individualistic society in the world. According to Geert 
Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory the U.S. scores 91 out of 100 on the Individualism Index 
making it one of the highest globally. This score indicates a cultu ral importance on personal 
freedom, self - reliance and individual achievement over group harmony or collective identity 
(Hofstede Insights, n.d.).  
In highly individualistic cultures like the U.S., people are primarily expected to look after 
themselves and their family. Success is also typically measured in terms of personal 
accomplishments such as career achievements, wealth or public recognition. Th e cultural story of 
the "American Dream" reinforces the idea that anyone can succeed through individual effort and 
determination.  
This conflicts with collectivist societies where group membership, loyalty and friendships are 
prioritized. In the U.S. independence is taught from an early age where children are encouraged to 
make their own decisions, express their personal opinions and  develop a unique identity.  
A typical American teenager might leave their hometown at 18 to attend university in another 
state, a move that reflects both independence and social expectation. In collectivist cultures like 
China or India young adults may remain with or close to their f amilies much longer.  
The U.S. is also a low - context communication culture which means people are more direct and 
clear. This aligns with individualistic values like self - expression and assertiveness are seen as 
strengths. Silence in conversations is often uncomfortable as it m ay be interpreted as a lack of 
opinion or disengagement.  
In a professional setting American employees are expected to speak up during meetings and ask 
questions. Performance reviews often focus on individual contributions and rewards such as 
promotions or bonuses are usually individual  rather   than group based.  
Individual responsibility is both empowering and stressful. But while it creates room for innovation 
and personal growth it can also lead to pressure as individuals may feel only accountable for their 
successes or failures. But I do feel like Americans can   also be more confident in themselves than 
other  countries .  
In customer service Americans generally expect responses. If there's a problem ,   customers are 
encouraged to voice complaints directly and companies see this as valuable feedback.   
The high level of individualism in the U.S. shapes everything from education and work to family life 
and communication. While this promotes self - expression, innovation and freedom it also means 
that individuals must navigate life largely on their own. Unde rstanding these traits is essential for 
intercultural communication, especially when working with or within American society.

Choose a culture from a different continent than the previous cultures you discussed. Research 
masculinity   and the prevalence of the  male gaze   in that culture. Cite your sources, separate fact 
from opinion and give specific examples. Comparing your chosen culture to other cultures may help 
you make your point more clearly. Make sure that all comparisons are rooted in verifiable facts. Aim 
at 600 to 650 words.  
 
Masculinity and the Male Gaze in Hungary  
 
Hungary is one of the most traditionally  masculine countries in Europe. According to Hofstede's 
Masculinity Index, it scores 88 out of 100. That means Hungarian culture tends to value things like 
competition, ambition and success. People often measure success by how much money someone 
makes, thei r job title or what they own. There are also clearer expectations for how men and 
women should behave with more pressure to stick to traditional gender roles.  
 
In Hungary, men are often expected to be strong, confident and not show too much emotion. 
M eanwhile   women , are more likely to be judged based on how they look or how well they take 
care of a family. This ties into the idea of the male gaze, a way of seeing the world where women 
are mainly viewed through a man's perspective, often as objects of beauty rather t han full 
complex people.  
 
You can see this in Hungarian media. On TV and in ads, women are often shown as housewives, 
love interests or models, while men are shown as leaders, workers or problem - solvers. In talent 
shows or reality TV, women often get comments about their appearance   or outfits, while men are 
judged more for what they do. This reinforces the idea that women should be looked at and men 
should act.  
 
This divide also shows up at work. In Hungary, far fewer women hold leadership roles compared to 
the European average. Men are more likely to be seen as the ones in charge, while women are 
often expected to take on support roles. Things are changing slowly , but it can still be harder for 
women to get ahead in careers that reward assertiveness and dominance, traits that are more 
traditionally linked with masculinity.  
 
Masculinity also shapes how emotions are handled. Hungarian men are usually expected to stay 
tough and keep their feelings to themselves. Being independent and in control is valued more than 
being open or vulnerable. Because of this, many men feel pressure   to hide their stress or mental 
health struggles, which can lead to serious issues that go untreated.  
 
On the  other   side, Sweden is one of the least masculine countries, scoring just 5 out of 100 on the 
same index. Swedish culture puts more emphasis on things like quality of life, cooperation and 
balance between work and personal life. Gender roles are more flexible an d both men and women 
are encouraged to show emotion and share responsibilities at home and work.  
 
For example, in Sweden both parents are given generous leave when they have a child and it's 
totally normal for dads to stay home and take care of their kids. In Hungary, even though the same 
leave exists, it's mostly mothers who use it. Swedish media also   tends to show more realistic and 
respectful portrayals of women, with less focus on how they look and more on who they are.  
 
Hungary is slowly changing, but traditional masculine values still shape how people think about 
gender, power and identity. Understanding these cultural patterns helps explain both the 
challenges people face and the progress that's being made. When you com pare it to Sweden, it 
becomes clear how different ideas about masculinity and gender roles can really shape everyday 
life, from the workplace and media to relationships and emotional well - being.

Choose a culture from a different continent than the previous cultures you discussed. Research the 
Uncertainty Avoidance Index   of a specific culture. Try to narrow down that culture as much as 
possible. Cite your sources, separate fact from opinion and give specific examples. Aim for 400 to 450 
words.  
Understanding Uncertainty Avoidance in Portugal  
Portugal is one of the countries with the highest scores on Hofstede's Uncertainty Avoidance 
Index, scoring 104 just behind Greece at the top of the list. This means that people in  Portugal 
generally don't like uncertainty or unexpected changes. They prefer things to be clear, well -
planned and organized.  
In Portuguese culture rules and structure are very important. People like to know what to expect 
and often follow systems that help reduce the unknown. For example, in the workplace decisions 
usually go through a proper process with signatures, official do cuments or approvals. Things aren't 
typically done on the spot or without a plan. Everything tends to be carefully thought out and 
discussed ahead of time.  
The same goes for their daily life and education. Students are taught to follow set rules and stick to 
what the curriculum says. There's not as much focus on thinking outside the box or doing things in 
new ways. Being prepared and sticking to the plan is w hat makes people feel secure.  
Of course, this way of thinking also shows up in how people deal with time. Punctuality is 
important and planning ahead is common. People like to know what's happening next instead of 
just going with the flow.  
On the other hand, this need for certainty can sometimes slow things down. It might make it 
harder for new ideas or changes to take place quickly. For example, in places like Denmark or 
Jamaica countries with a low UAI, the people are more relaxed about ru les and more open to 
change. They're comfortable figuring things out as they go, while in Portugal people tend to feel 
more stressed if there's no clear plan or structure.  
Portuguese culture values stability, clear instructions and careful  planning. This makes the country 
feel safe and predictable for many people. But it can also mean that creativity or quick changes 
take longer to be accepted. Knowing this can really help when working with Portuguese people or 
businesses, as it helps you un derstand why they may prefer doing things a certain way.

Research  Long - Term Orientation   in a culture that you have not discussed yet. Try to narrow down 
that culture as much as possible. Cite your sources, separate fact from opinion and give specific 
examples. Aim at 200 to 250 words.  
Long - Term Orientation in Japan  
Japan is a prime example of a high Long - Term Orientation culture. According to Hofstede's 
framework, Japan ranks high in this dimension, meaning its society values future rewards, 
perseverance and continuous self - improvement (Hofstede   Insights, n.d.).  
T his long - term mindset is deeply embedded in Japanese business culture and social life. Japanese 
companies like Toyota and Sony are renowned for their focus on sustainable growth, long - term 
planning and quality through methods such as  Kaizen .  T he practice of continuous improvement. 
These companies often prioritize long - term reputation over short - term profits, making decisions 
that may take years to  develop .  
Education is another area where Japan's high LTO is evident. Students are expected to dedicate 
themselves to academic and moral development from an early age and competition for entrance 
into prestigious universities is intense. This cultural commitment an d discipline is mirrored in 
Japan's strong work ethic and respect for elders and teachers.  
While I respect the discipline and planning behind Japan's high LTO, it honestly sounds exhausting. 
It's common that employees can't leave the office until their boss does and if the boss wants to go 
out for drinks   you're expected to go. That level of social  obligation and pressure explains why so 
many people are tired and burnt out. It's a system that values long - term gains, but it seems to 
come at the cost of personal well - being.

Research  Indulgence   in a culture that you have not discussed yet, from any continent. Try to narrow 
down that culture as much as possible. Cite your sources, separate fact from opinion and give specific 
examples. Comparing your chosen culture to other cultures may help you m ake your point more 
clearly. Make sure that all comparisons are rooted in verifiable facts. Aim at 250 to 300 words.  
Indulgence in Mexican Culture  
Mexico is one of the most indulgent countries in the world, scoring 97 out of 100 on Hofstede's 
Indulgence Index. That basically means people in Mexico believe in enjoying life, expressing 
emotions and having fun. There's a strong cultural focus on living in the moment and finding joy in 
everyday experiences.  
 
One clear example of this is how Mexicans celebrate. Holidays like Día de los Muertos (Day of the 
Dead) and Las Posadas are full of  colour , music, dancing and food. These aren't just parties ,  they're 
deep traditions that show how important it is to celebrate life, even when remembering those 
who have passed. Community gatherings and emotional expression are at the heart of these 
events.  
 
In day - to - day life, you also see this indulgent mindset. People in Mexico often value personal time, 
relationships and enjoyment more than strict routines. There's a popular saying: "Mexicans don't 
live to work ,   they work to live." That really captures how fun, connection and enjoying the present 
are seen as essential parts of life.  
 
You'll also notice that people tend to be warm and expressive. Hugs, cheek kisses and lively 
conversations are common. Whether it's through music, dancing or just chatting with friends, 
showing emotion openly is a normal and welcome part of social life.  
 
When you compare this to more restrained cultures ,  like Russia or Pakistan ,  there's a big 
difference. In those places social norms or religious rules often limit open emotional expression or 
indulgent  behaviour . In contrast, Mexico encourages people to be spontaneous, optimistic and 
emotionally open.  
 
In a work setting, this cultural style can be important to understand. Celebrating birthdays or 
promotions at the office is common and building personal connections can help build trust. At the 
same time people from more structured cultures, like Germany o r Japan, might find Mexico's 
relaxed attitude toward time or deadlines a bit challenging. That's why cultural awareness 
matters,  being flexible and respectful goes a long way.  
 
Overall, indulgence is a big part of what makes Mexican culture so lively and welcoming. It's not 
just about having fun ,  it's about finding joy in life, expressing yourself freely and staying connected 
to others.

4. Professional Growth  
How did you experience the  International Days   in March? Did you notice any cultural differences in 
the workshops you attended? Were you able to network or learn anything new? Can you see the 
value in intercultural exchange of knowledge and experience?  
 
Quinten:   I really liked the team  project,   but  I   didn't find the lectures useful.   The  lectures   felt more 
like a promotional advertisement for their business / school.   The fact that they were from a 
different country didn't highlight a different culture at all. The lecturers mostly just taught   about 
what they  do, and it wasn't really that useful for me .  
 
As for the  team  project,   I really liked working with students with a different study program. A 
team member studied  agriculture   so he could guide us with his knowledge about  farming and 
possibilities .   Another member studied business, so he was very strong at pitching our idea.  Now 
the unfortunate part was that we had no international student in our team so we basically all had 
Belgian culture. There were 2 foreign   teachers, but their help didn't feel any more different than a 
Belgian teacher.  
 
So all in al l, it was a fun learning experience featuring teamwork  with colleagues studying different 
capabilities.  However,   I didn't feel any impact or benefit of calling it a multicultural international 
da y. This day felt more like a forced "work in  English " day .  
 
Alexander:   I find that the workshops I attended  didn't have any cultural differences other th a n 
speaking good English because the first lecture  it was difficult to understand sometimes.  I learned 
that   working with a team you have never seen before or talked to is very difficult if you have to 
make a project on the same day.  But it did show me how intercultural exchange can add value to a 
project.  
At some point this schoolyear, you will attend a guest lecture by  Sophie Mirgaux . What did you learn 
from this lecture? How did you perform in the workshop? Aim for 75 to 150 words.  
 
Quinten:   Sophie Mirgaux works with the Belgian federal government   in   Belgium's Special Envoy 
for the Ocean .  The ocean doesn't have a voice for itself, so she acts a bit like the ocean's voice. She 
spoke about her role in  the UN with Diplomats and negotiators .   She talked about our importance 
and activities at  Belgium's   sea. Activities like p ioneering with windmills, researching the ocean, 
experimenting and innovating system for the ocean , even preserving nature, life and habitats in 
the ocean .   Belgium doesn't have that much power as the US and  Russia   which have a lot of 
conflicting opinions.  
 
There is a lot of negotiating in EU's  rotating presidency system, they need to prepare a lot of 
proposals for Belgium to have a better chance of being included.   A lot of focus was put on the fact 
that waste will end up in the ocean, thus ending up in our bodies. This en courages  us to recycle.  
 
Alexander:   From t his video  I learned that   culture affects the way we communicate , n ot just what 
we say ,   but how we say it. Sherwood Fleming talked about something called "cultural autopilot" 
where we all have these default ways of speaking based on where  we   are   from and we don't even 
realize it. She als o said   that all communication basically boils down to five things: making requests, 
offers, promises, sharing opinions and declarations. What really stuck with me is how easily 
misunderstandings can happen even when everyone speaks English , j ust because of tone or body 
language. The biggest tip was to keep things clear and simple especially in international or 
business situations. It's not about sounding super fancy . I t's about making sure the other person 
gets what you mean .   ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okx6blzW1Kw )  
 
In general, what have you learned from your research and the classes and events you attended? This 
encompasses both the first and second semester. How would you use these new perspectives in your 
future career ?  
 
Alexander:   Looking back at everything I worked on during this course, I've definitely learned a lot. 
Not just about IT, history or culture, but also about myself.   
One of the biggest things I noticed is that I'm now more aware of how culture shapes the way 
people live, think and work. Before, I didn't really pay much attention to cultural differences or 
their impact. But after researching these topics I've started to   see things from a wider perspective.   
Also learning how to deal with different types of people and how to give presentations.   
Visiting the Africa Museum especially changed my view on museums. I used to think they were 
boring, but after that visit it showed me how meaningful they can be. It even made me curious to 
visit more.  
 
Quinten:   This assignment showed me how much culture affects how people work, think, and 
communicate. Different countries have different values, like how they handle power, emotions, or 
personal space, and that really matters in teamwork , especially when there are different cultures 
working together .   What stood out to me most was how useful it is to work with people from 
different backgrounds or fields. Everyone brings something different, and it makes the end result 
stronger   and have more perspectives . I di dn't just learn facts ,  I learned how to be more aware and 
flexible, which I think will help in any future job.

            <pre>
Communication Skills  2   І   202 4 - 205      
My convincing and negotiating strategies  
[ Quinten De Meyer ]  
1.  Convincing others  
Reflect  on the class on 'convincing others'  from  week 21   and discuss what you learned from it. Here 
are a few prompts that can help you out:  
•   What was the  most surprising or eye - opening concept you learned about persuasion during this 
class? Why did it stand out to you?  
•   Which convincing tactic do you think would be the hardest for you to use in real life? Why might 
you struggle with it?  
•   Reflecting on your own communication style, what aspect of persuasion do you feel most 
confident about? Which aspect do you think needs the most improvement, and how can you work 
on that?  
 
I learned that relationship had a lot to do with how future negotiations would play out. Aspects 
like trust, mutual understanding. Persuasion and negotiation is not just the arguments itself, but 
also the person you interact with.  
 
The tactic I would find hardest to use is  emotional appeal . This is because I'll have to make 
something up and I don't think they would believe my act at all. I'd rather lie about the  product or 
thing we are negotiating about, like the rarity or final chance to come to an agreeme nt. Building 
pressure on the other person with these tactics is more my style than to play on emotions.  
 
 
How do you balance emotional appeals with logical reasoning when trying to persuade someone? 
Can you think of a time when you successfully (or unsuccessfully) used one or the other?  
 
I like to use logical reasoning more, it's less of a  weaponisation because you're using facts instead 
of gathering opinions. For emotional appeal it's harder to make something up and act to try and 
dishonestly play on their emotions I just don't like that .  
 
 
Persuasion can be powerful. How do you think ethical boundaries should be maintained when using 
convincing tactics? Can you recall a situation where persuasion was used unethically ?  
 
Yes, should have ethical boundaries especially with high stakes. You should not be fully misleading 
or withhold information that might be disastrous in the future. On time there was a parking lot 
that said only €3 for 30 minutes but in small text almost im possible to read it stated if parked 
longer than 2 hours = price €45.  
 
2.  Negotiation  
In  week 22 , you will play the 2 $   Game. Answer the following questions:  
•   What did you learn about your own negotiation tactics?   
•   Did you act differently because of the time limit?   
•   In the third round, when you had to negotiate with the same person again, did you change 
tactics? Was the relationship changed because of the previous negotiation? How and why?   
•   Overall, what did you learn from this game?  
 
I learned that I could not really come up with a good excuse but a positive I learnt was that I was 
pretty effective   at finding holes and solutions in their story for my gain.  This means that I don't 
have to focus on my story, and they don't get the chance to focus on my story if I keep pressuring 
about theirs.  The time limit helped me get to a deal quickly and pressure more, using it to my 
advantage. Because we had to negotiate with the same person again I could easily utilize the same 
tactics because they   made the same mistakes as last time and I expected it. The relationship didn't 
hurt negotiations.   
 
I learnt that people in this game don't want to come to an agreement based on their story, they 
want to win the game based on the money goal. So even if I gave a perfect solution to their story 
the person I  negotiated   with went silent   and said that it's not part of the game to offer solutions  
and they just need the money, not the solution.   In my opinion this is not playing the game 
correctly.  
 
 
In  week 23 , you will learn about negotiation strategies. Answer the following questions:  
•   What  are the tactics that you (subconsciously) used  called?    
•   When are these tactics appropriate and when are they inappropriate?  
•   If you could go back to last week and change your actions, which tactics would you use instead? 
Why?  
 
•   Anchoring   –   Starting with a strong, strategic opening offer.  
•   Framing   –   Telling   facts in a way that benefits my side.  
•   Hardball tactics   –   Such as exploiting time pressure or ignoring their story to shift focus.  
•   Concessions   –   I made small  concessions in price   to appear  kind   while aiming for my ideal 
outcome , because my first offer was higher than needed.  
The se tactics   become  inappropriate   if they involve deception that crosses ethical boundaries or if 
used in  integrative negotiations , which depend on  trust   and  shared information .  
 
What I would change is I would just give them their way with the money  if they won't budge. So 
it's at least a lose/win situation instead of a lose/lose.  
 
3 .  Growth as an IT professional  
What did you learn about convincing and negotiating ethically? How would you use this in your 
future IT career? Or maybe: what would you certainly not do? How would you deal with someone 
who tries to convince you or negotiate with you unethically?  
 
What I learned is that you  must   be careful with how you convince and negotiate, especially in a 
work setting. I don't think you should cross the line just to win. There's a difference between using 
tactics and being completely unethical. If you lie too much or hide important info, it al ways comes 
back to you later. In IT, if you oversell a product or hide a bug just to close a deal, you're going to 
ruin trust and maybe your job too.  
 
For me, I wouldn't go that far. I'm okay with playing the game — like using pressure, creating 
urgency, or even bluffing a  bit — but I wouldn't mislead someone to the point where it becomes 
damaging. Especially if someone else is trying to negotiate with me in a shady way, like faking rules 
or trying to guilt - trip me, I'd either call it out or push back. I don't like being playe d, and I don't 
play dirty unless they start it.  
 
In the future, I'll just stick to using smart strategies   and tactics   like anchoring, framing, or using 
time pressure when needed. I think being sharp and confident is better than trying to be the "nice 
guy" all the time. You can still win deals without being dishonest. You just have to know when to 
push and when to walk aw ay.  
 
My favorite   strategy when I have to buy something and negotiate the price is to act like I don't 
really care about it. I'll show almost no interest, mention I have other options, and start pointing 
out every little flaw or issue with it. That way, the seller starts t hinking, "He's not going to buy 
this," and they feel like they have to lower the price just to make the sale. I'll throw in a lowball 
offer, and most of the time, they'll accept because they think no one else will want it either
